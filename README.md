Vellore Fort is a large 16th-century fort situated in heart of the Vellore city, in the state of Tamil Nadu,
 India built by Vijayanagara kings. 
The fort was at one time the headquarters of the Aravidu Dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire. 
The fort is known for its grand ramparts, wide moat and robust masonry.
The fort's ownership passed from Vijayanagara kings, to the Bijapur sultans, to the Marathas, to the Carnatic Nawabs
 and finally to the British, who held the fort until India gained independence. The Indian government maintains the 
 fort with the Archaeological Department. During British rule, the Tipu Sultan's family and the last king of Sri Lanka, 
 Sri Vikrama Rajasinha were held as prisoners in the fort. It is also a witness to the massacre of the Vijayanagara 
 royal family of Sriranga Raya. The fort houses the Jalakanteswarar Hindu temple, the Christian St. John's Church
  and a Muslim mosque, of which the Jalakanteswarar Temple is famous for its magnificent carvings.[1] The first 
  significant military rebellion against British rule erupted at this fort in 1806.[2]

Vellore Fort is one of the most popular tourist destinations for both domestic and international visitors to Tamil Nadu.
